            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching 
                for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch 
                at home.  Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase 
                your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. 
                Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say 
                whatever they want about your business. 
                Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what 
                potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. 
                Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited 
                to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase 
                your lead generation.

            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for 
                your business, bringing customers directly to your website.

                Users find your business through paid and organic searches, 
                increasing the search ranking and visibility for your business.

            <p>
                As the search ranking for your business increases, 
                your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to 
                advertise your page.
