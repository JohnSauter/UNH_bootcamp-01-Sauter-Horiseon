# UNH_bootcamp-01-Sauter-Horiseon
The Horiseon web site, with improved accessibility.
The title is improved and one broken link is fixed.
The images have alternate textual identification.
The semantic structure is improved.

In addition to accessibility improvements the
code is cleaner and has better comments, making
future work more efficient.

It is not clear that Horiseon has the rights to
the images on this web site.  I recommend research 
into these images, and replacing them if necessary 
to avoid copyright violations.  I can create
unique images for the Horiseon web site which depict
Horiseon's people and facilities.

The updated web site is at this URL:
https://johnsauter.github.io/UNH_bootcamp-01-Sauter-Horiseon/

Here is a screen shot of the web site:
