# UNH_bootcamp-01-Sauter-Horiseon
Horiseon web site made accessible

The week 1 assignment in the UNH coding bootcamp
is to make the Horiseon web site more accessible.

The web site contains a generic picture of people
sitting around a table with a white board behind them.
Below that is a box to select Search Engine Optimization,
one for Online Reputation Management and one for
Social Media Marketing.

We begin with the HTML, CSS and image files which
make up the page.
