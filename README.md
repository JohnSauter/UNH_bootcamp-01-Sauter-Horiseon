# UNH_bootcamp-01-Sauter-Horiseon
Horiseon web site made accessible

The week 1 assignment in the UNH coding bootcamp
is to make the Horiseon web site more accessible.

We begin with the HTML, CSS and image files provided 
as a starting point for the exercise.

Fix the title and the ID for the SEO section.

Add alt= to the images.  This is a little more
complex for the image at the top of the page,
since it is a background image.

Improve the semantic structure by making
the right column h2, just like the left column.
This requires some changes to the CSS.

Remove redundency in the CSS.

Add notes about possible copyright infringement
on the images.
